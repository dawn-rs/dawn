//! # twilight-model
//!
//! See the [`twilight`] documentation for more information.
//!
//! `twilight-model` is a crate of serde models defining the Discord APIs with
//! few convenience methods on top of them.
//!
//! These are in a single crate for ease of use, a single point of definition,
//! and a sort of versioning of the Discord API. Similar to how a database
//! schema progresses in versions, the definition of the API also progresses in
//! versions.
//!
//! The types in this crate are reproducible: deserializing a payload into a
//! type, serializing it, and then deserializing it again will work.
//!
//! Defined are a number of modules defining types returned by or owned by
//! resource categories. For example, `gateway` are types used to interact with
//! and returned by the gateway API. `guild` contains types owned by the Guild
//! resource category. These types may be directly returned by, built on top of,
//! or extended by other crates.
//!
//! ### Installation
//!
//! This crate requires Rust 1.31+.
//!
//! Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! twilight-model = "0.1"
//! ```
