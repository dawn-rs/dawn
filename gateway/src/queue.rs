/// A local, in-process implementation of a [`Queue`] which manages the
/// connection attempts of one or more [`Shard`]s.
///
/// The queue will take incoming requests and then queue them, releasing one of
/// the requests every 6 seconds. The queue is necessary because there's a
/// ratelimit on how often shards can initiate sessions.
///
/// You usually won't need to handle this yourself, because the [`Cluster`] will
/// do that for you when managing multiple shards.
///
/// # When not to use this
///
/// This queue implementation is "local", meaning it's intended to be used if
/// you manage shards only in this process. If you run shards in multiple
/// different processes (do you utilize microservices a lot?), then you **must
/// not** use this implementation. Shards across multiple processes may
/// create new sessions at the same time, which is bad.
///
/// It should also not be used for very large sharding, for that the
/// [`LargeBotQueue`] can be used.
///
/// If you can't use this, look into an alternative implementation of the
/// [`Queue`], such as the [`gateway-queue`] broker.
